# auth.py handles user authentication for the Pizza Slice web application.
# It defines routes for user login, account creation, and logout using Flask routes.
# WTForms is used to validate form inputs for both sign-in and sign-up forms.
# User data such as email, password, and role is stored in users.json.
# The purpose of this file is to manage who can access the app by checking user credentials and managing sessions.
# It ensures that only logged-in users can access protected pages like placing or viewing pizza orders.
# Sessions are used to keep users logged in and to store their role, which helps control what they can see or do.
