# app.py is  main file of the Pizza Slice Flask app.
# It sets the Flask app, loads environment variables, configures app settings,
# and registers route blueprints from `auth.py` and `pizza.py`.

# Key responsibilities:
                    #  - Loads environment variables from .flaskenv using load_dotenv().
                    #  - Loads app settings (e.g. port, debug, etc.) from settings.py.
                    #  - Sets the secret key used for session management.
                    #  - Registers route functions by calling auth_routes(app) and pizza_routes(app).
                    #  - Starts the web server if this file is run directly .
